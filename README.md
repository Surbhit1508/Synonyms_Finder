# If you are facing problems like the following:
The error you're encountering, `getaddrinfo failed`, suggests that your system is having trouble resolving the hostname `api.wordsapi.com` to an IP address. This could be due to various reasons, including network issues or DNS configuration problems.

Here are a few steps you can take to resolve this issue:

1. **Check your Internet Connection**: Ensure that your computer has a working internet connection. Try accessing other websites or making external requests to confirm connectivity.

2. **DNS Configuration**: It's possible that your DNS (Domain Name System) settings are misconfigured. You can try changing your DNS server to a public DNS service like Google's (8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4) or Cloudflare's (1.1.1.1).

3. **Firewall or Security Software**: Sometimes, firewall or security software can block outgoing connections. Check if you have any security software that might be interfering with your requests.

4. **Proxy Settings**: If you're behind a corporate network or using a VPN, proxy settings might be affecting your ability to make external requests. Ensure that your proxy settings are correctly configured.

5. **Network Restrictions**: If you're on a restricted network (e.g., a corporate network), it's possible that network policies are preventing certain outbound connections. Contact your network administrator for assistance.

6. **Temporary Outage**: Occasionally, websites and APIs experience temporary outages. You can check if the WordsAPI website is accessible through a web browser.

After checking these steps, if you're still unable to resolve the issue, it might be related to your network environment, and you may need to contact your network administrator or IT support for further assistance.
